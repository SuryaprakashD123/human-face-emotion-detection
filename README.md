Overview
This project implements a face emotion detection system using Python and image processing techniques. The system is designed to identify and classify human emotions from facial expressions in images. It leverages machine learning and deep learning libraries to achieve accurate emotion recognition.

Features
Detects and classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and neutral.
Utilizes pre-trained models for facial emotion detection.
Provides real-time emotion classification on images.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
TensorFlow: Framework for building and training machine learning models.
Keras: High-level API for neural networks in TensorFlow.
OpenCV: Library for computer vision and image processing.
NumPy: Library for numerical operations and array handling.
Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your dataset or use the provided sample images.
Run the emotion detection script:
python detect_emotion.py
The script will process the images and output the detected emotions.
